# Android application artifacts

Use the connected server's advertised Android tools. Repository main and npm
4.1.0 include this family. A skill installation alone cannot add it to an
older server.

Start with `inspect_android_package` on the caller's APK path for package
identity, manifest declarations, coverage, and inline Evidence. Use
`search_android_classes` to find candidates, `inspect_android_class` for one
class's members, `inspect_android_method` for decompilation, and
`trace_android_references` for incoming static references. Each call takes its
own APK path and explicit selectors; do not open a native session first.
Choose an `overload_index` from the class inventory when methods are ambiguous
instead of guessing.

The provider requires a separately supplied headless JADX MCP JAR 0.7.1 and
Java 17 or newer. `REA_JADX_MCP_JAR` selects the absolute JAR path; `JAVA_HOME`
can select Java. REA setup does not install or configure that JAR, and doctor
provider scopes cover Hopper/Ghidra rather than JADX. Use existing tools and
report missing prerequisites for the Android task specifically.

Real verification covers Linux. macOS has the POSIX launch boundary but no
claimed real-provider verification; Windows is unsupported. Calls use one
worker, a bounded JVM heap, and provider deadlines. The APK is never launched,
and no emulator is required.

Manifest entries and decompiled text are static observations, not execution or
policy enforcement. Incoming references are recovered static relationships;
reflection, dynamic loading, and unresolved calls remain unknown. Preserve
artifact digests, locations, diagnostics, and incomplete coverage. For archive
members rather than code analysis, use `open_binary` and `inspect_artifact`.
