# Android application artifacts

Start with `inspect_android_package` on the caller's APK path for package
identity, manifest declarations, coverage, and inline Evidence. Use
`search_android_classes` to find candidates, `inspect_android_class` for one
class's members, `inspect_android_method` for decompilation, and
`trace_android_references` for incoming static references. Each call takes its
own APK path and explicit selectors; do not open a native session first.
Choose an `overload_index` from the class inventory when methods are ambiguous
instead of guessing.

The provider requires a separately supplied headless JADX MCP JAR 0.7.1 and
a full JDK 17 or newer, including `jdk.compiler`. `REA_JADX_MCP_JAR` selects the
absolute JAR path; `JAVA_HOME` can select Java. Nothing installs them; report a
missing prerequisite for the Android task specifically.

Calls use one worker and provider deadlines (`REA_JADX_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS`,
default 120000). On a running server, set `jadx.operation_timeout_ms` through
`update_analysis_settings` and retry once work and cleanup settle. The APK is
never launched, and no emulator is required.

Manifest entries and decompiled text are static observations, not execution or
policy enforcement. Incoming references are recovered static relationships;
reflection, dynamic loading, and unresolved calls remain unknown. Preserve
artifact digests, locations, diagnostics, and incomplete coverage. For archive
members rather than code analysis, use `open_binary` and `inspect_artifact`.
